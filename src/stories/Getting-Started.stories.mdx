# Fleet Air Web Components

Welcome to the Fleet Air Web Components library! This is a React/Storybook component library that mirrors Fleet Air (Compose) components for web prototyping.

## 🏗️ Built With

- **React 19** - Modern React with latest features
- **TypeScript** - Type safety and better developer experience  
- **Radix UI** - Unstyled, accessible component primitives
- **Class Variance Authority** - Type-safe component variants
- **Storybook 9** - Component development and documentation
- **Vite** - Fast build tool and dev server

## 🎯 Goals

1. **Mirror Fleet Air components** - Recreate Compose components for web
2. **Accessibility first** - Built on Radix UI primitives
3. **Type safety** - Full TypeScript support
4. **Developer experience** - Easy to use and extend
5. **Prototyping ready** - Drop into any React app

## 📁 Structure

```
src/
├── components/          # React components
├── lib/                # Utilities and helpers
└── stories/            # Storybook documentation
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

Components will be added to the `src/components/` directory with corresponding stories in `src/stories/`.

Each component follows this pattern:
- Built on Radix UI primitives for accessibility
- Styled with CSS-in-JS or Tailwind classes
- Documented with Storybook stories
- Exported from `src/components/index.ts`

## 🔧 Development

```bash
npm run storybook      # Start development server
npm run build-storybook # Build static site
```

Ready to start building! 🎨
